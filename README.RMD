## Read Me for Code



The code as per the Run_Analysis works as follows:

1. Load all the training data along with subject and activity data into dataframes
2. Load all the test data along with subject and activity data into dataframes
3. Merge training and test data by using cbind and rbind functions
4. Then cleanse each of the measured data in each row and column by unfactoring, unlisting and omitting blanks/NAs
5. Take the mean and standard deviation of each of the measurements and add to the Merged Data Set.
6. Assign descriptive names to all columns
7. Relabel the Activities with Descriptive name
8. Find the average of each measurement for every activity and subject 
9. Write the tidy set into a text file

Note: I tried to use function to cleanse the data but it runs forever in my system
